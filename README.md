###Approach	for	Pool	Two	â€“ Developer	Pool
The	following	documents	our	development	approach	once	we	initiated	resources	to	create	our	prototype. We are	following	the	U.S.	Digital	Service	Playbook as the reference guideline for executing this project:
 - Product	owner	and	lead		- Vishal	Maheshwari
 - Technical	Architect - Shyam	Nagarajan
 - Front	End	Developer -Depak	Sabu
 - Dev	Ops	Engineer - Nabil	Soulane
 - Backend	Developer- Vimal	Kovath
  
##### Our	Technology	Stack/Framework
######Development	technology and Tools:

```sh 
  Agile Project Management: Redmine
  Testing Framework: Protractor,Mocha,Chai,Jasmine
  Development IDE:Sublime Text 3
```

######Runtime Deployment technology stack:

```sh 
  Frontend client Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3, Angular JS
  Backend Server Technologies: Node JS, SailsJS
  Database: Redis for session store and MongoDB for model persistence
```
The above technology was chosen to have a clear seperation of client and server where all the calls are made through REST Webservices. This allows for future enablement for mobile devices.
